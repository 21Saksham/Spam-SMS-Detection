# Spam-SMS-Detection
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset consists of labeled text messages, where each message is categorized as spam (unwanted, promotional, or fraudulent) or ham (legitimate communication).
